  "Calculus": {
    "disease": "Calculus",
    "description": "Calculus, commonly known as tartar, is a hardened dental plaque that forms when plaque is not removed. It is a critical indicator of oral health, affecting both aesthetics and contributing to gum disease by harboring bacteria. Unlike plaque, calculus cannot be removed through regular brushing and requires professional dental intervention.",
    "treatment": "The primary treatment for calculus is professional dental cleaning, also known as scaling and root planing. These procedures involve the removal of tartar using specialized instruments. To prevent the formation of calculus, it is essential to maintain optimal oral hygiene practices, including regular brushing, flossing, and dental check-ups.",

Caries are caused by acid-producing bacteria in dental plaque and are influenced by dietary habits, oral hygiene, and fluoride exposure.",
    "treatment": "Early-stage caries may be reversible with fluoride treatments. More advanced decay requires restorative procedures such as fillings, crowns, or root canals. Prevention includes regular dental care, using fluoride toothpaste, dental sealants for children, and reducing sugary and acidic foods and drinks.",
